                hi, i'm kevin. i'm currently a student attending seneca college's computer programming & analysis
                program.
                i'm still exploring my ambitions, but for the moment, i am dedicated to learning as much as i can!
                <br><br>
                <hr><br>
                in my free time, my main hobbies are cooking and video games. i have already begun using those are bases
                for personal projects of mine.
                with time, i can hopefully both improve my skills and make something fun!
                <br><br>

                    inspired by old-school text games like the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy game, colossal cave adventure, and zork,
                    i'm putting a modern twist on a classic genre.<br><br>the project utilizes godot, a pretty up-and-coming game engine which uses gdscript, a language with similar syntax to python,
                    which is designed specifically for use with the godot engine.<br><br>i've also been able to have some fun with the project and mess around with other aspects of gamedev like sound
                    design and foley or area and level design which are all things i have never worked with before.<br><br>the project hasn't necessarily been the most challenging in terms of learning
                    new technologies or using complex logic, but it has taught me a great deal about the complete life cycle of a product. proper planning/documentation, managing scope, and testing are
                    all things that i've been taught in practice, but now i really get why they are necessary.

                <div>
                    after <a href="assets\met2.jpg" target="_blank" class="projects-link">visiting the met</a> on a trip to new york city, i found a lot of the art to be kind of inspiring. some of the
                    pieces are truly ancient, and knowing that someone's stuff from hundreds of thousands of years ago is being shared and studied after all this time is quite cool.<br><br>the cataloguer is
                    a full stack web application that allows users to search through and find information about different pieces of art shared at the met. the project built on what i already knew about nodeJS,
                    RESTful APIs, and database management with mongoDB. the big step with this project, however, was using it as an introduction to react.<br><br>although i'm still on somewhat shaky
                    ground in regards to react, knowing that i was able to complete a full stack project to this scale motivates me to keep going.
